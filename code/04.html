                <p>
                    In Theme 04, Basic Animation, we learned about various design principles and animational designs
                    such as flat design,
                    kawaii, baby bias, bouba and Kiki, asymmetry, etc.

                    I chose to use the bouba principle to solve the subsequent task by designing my game, "How to Feta",
                    with mainly round
                    and child-friendly shapes, opposite to the sharp and angular shapes of Kiki.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I opted for this
                    principle in my solution
                    instead of kawaii or Kiki because I wanted more cartoon-like characters and landscapes. Kawaii
                    refers to the cute, and
                    Kiki to the sharp, and I felt that neither of these directions aligned with the design I envisioned
                    for my game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we learned about planning and structuring the design process, keeping the user and the
                    task's goals in
                    mind. I applied this knowledge to transition from idea to product, but looking back at the task, I
                    approached it
                    differently than I would have today.
                </p>
                <p>I started by drawing my characters before I had sketched my
                    game pages or
                    brainstormed my ideas. This led me to realize just before the deadline that I had i.e. completely
                    overlooked the rule of
                    thirds. My game pages did not have three layers and, therefore, did not feel super abstract or
                    well-thought-out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is
                    the key lesson I took from that theme – it's important to start from scratch, brainstorm, and
                    investigate the task
                    before diving into drawing and coding. This made my project start at an unusual point in the
                    process, and as a result, I
                    felt like I was constantly struggling to maintain a coherent thread through the design, coding, and
                    potential
                    development of the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The development process for the task in this theme can be seen in the attached screenshots below.
                    Personally, I found it
                    most challenging to grasp JavaScript, so I was particularly focused on improving my skills in the
                    subtasks assigned, and
                    especially in the redesign I carried out on my portfolio site from Theme 03 (as mentioned earlier).
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript was an
                    entirely new world of possibilities, and it was an overwhelming start to access that part of the
                    virtual sandbox in a
                    project like this, where my focus also lies in maintaining design principles and conventions,
                    gestalt laws, and layout
                    principles from previous projects and themes.
