                The case in this theme was to design and develop a topic site of your choice. I chose to try my hand at
                designing my own
                private portfolio. It should be noted that the prototype I
                submitted in this
                course is one that I have continued to work on throughout the semester as my skills and knowledge in
                design and coding
                have evolved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Theme 03, UX/UI, fundamentally revolved around the process of designing a website, more specifically
                designing and
                coding an experience based on research, user tests, and idea/concept development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I executed the task based on the qualitative data I collected during the ideation and execution of my
                site. The data I
                obtained from conducting UX research yielded the following result: users could understand the purpose of
                my site but
                felt that it lacked headers and local elements to make the site more user-friendly and clear. This
                prompted me to
                implement more titles and add more subpages to my menu to keep the different pages with their respective
                content clearly
                separated.
            </p>
            <p>
                The theme also taught us about the conventions that are important to remember when designing
                a UI. I
                implemented this learning by emphasizing global elements such as the logo and burger menu, and local
                elements such as
                buttons, headers, and links.
            </p>
            <p>
                The task was about recognizing that an idea, a design, or a feature may have a meaning for oneself, but
                a drastically
                different one for the user - depending on how they use this feature/site and why they use it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use
                user research to
                collect qualitative and quantitative data that we can then use to justify our choices/develop our site
                and/or feature
                off of. The user's experience is the cornerstone of any site's foundation, as it can have a significant
                impact on
                whether the user gets what they came for.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the work on my site, I quickly found through my desk research that similar portfolios in the same
                industry have
                very raw and minimalist designs. That's what I initially tried to design for my site. The grey site is
                the first draft,
                the green one is the final project.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I conducted tests such as 5-second tests, BERT tests, etc., and
                received
                feedback on the theme, I found out that users' interest in the site quickly waned due to a lack of
                engagement - the site
                was simply too boring. Therefore, in my spare time, I allowed myself to redesign the site with more
                pages and a
                completely new Matrix design. I used Javascript to design an animated letter rain, changed the logo and
                layout so that
                the site became more user-friendly and at the same time more consistent overall.
            </p>
            <p>
                I adopted a content
                strategy that the
                site should have very little copy and microcopy, but rather local ornaments such as images, graphics,
                and videos to
                showcase my work and the content of the portfolio. Thus, you could say that I delved deeper into the UI
                part of the
                project based on the data that the UX part provided me.
