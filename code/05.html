                <h1>05 FUNDAMENTAL CONTENT / <a href="https://mitrimedia.com/kea/05%20indhold/WIDEX/">Go to
                        site</a></h1>
            </div>
            <div id="tema_05_info_p">
                <p>In Theme 05, Basic Content, the main task was to redesign a website for a self-selected company. We
                    chose to redesign an
                    internal documentation site for Europe's largest hearing aid company, WIDEX.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this theme, we had to independently apply the processes, tools, and techniques we had learned
                    through the previous
                    themes. For an example, this meant using tools from theme 03, UX/UI, to research and collect data.
                    We employed BERT
                    tests and surveys to gather internal data within the company. Subsequently, we used 5-second tests
                    and observation tests
                    to evaluate our redesign with new users outside of the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This research quickly revealed that our primary challenges in the redesign lay in two aspects:
                    establishing a consistent
                    visual language between the company's external and internal sites and making the internal site
                    easier to navigate and
                    more user-friendly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To address these two main tasks, we specifically drew on our knowledge from theme 02 about design
                    principles and gestalt
                    laws, etc., to design the site's layout, structure, and local & global elements. By this, we mean
                    that we set up grids
                    to structure the site's content and redesigned all global elements such as navigation, burger menu,
                    and links to make
                    them clearer and straightforward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we implemented local elements like mouse trails and
                    buttons to provide
                    users with a better overview of their virtual location and footsteps. I used my knowledge of
                    minimalist design from
                    previous themes to make the header & menu, and my new knowledge of iFrames to attach .PDF’s to the
                    site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since this was our first complete group project of the semester, I have quite a few reflections to
                    note. The project
                    offered invaluable insights into the dynamics of collaborative work, shedding light on the diverse
                    ways in which
                    individuals approach tasks and projects. One major takeaway was the realization that these varied
                    working styles did
                    lead to miscommunication, resulting in a final product that lacked cohesion and alignment in some
                    areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Navigating through a group project underscored the importance of effective communication and
                    understanding each team
                    member's strengths and working preferences. Where some would use percentages in margins, others
                    would use rem, where
                    some would use one header, others would user another etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It felt as if we just let eachother do what we wanted and felt good at, and then met a few days
                    before the deadline to
                    gather our work. Looking back, this is not what was intended with this assignment & theme, as we
                    regularly got taught in
                    using scrums, dailies & a group-contract to avoid any problems and internal divide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In essence, this first group project served as a learning ground for understanding the complexities
                    of collaboration,
                    emphasizing the need for effective communication, adaptability, and a shared commitment to the
                    project's goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel
                    like we created what we wanted, and aligned the internal site to the external one, but that our
                    teamwork was a bit too
                    squared at times. These insights will undoubtedly shape my approach to future group endeavors - both
                    in the
                    professional, personal and educational realms.
