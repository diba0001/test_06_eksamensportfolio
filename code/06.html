                <h1>05.1 FUNDEMENTAL VIDEO / <a href="http://mitrimedia.com/kea/05%20indhold/">Go to
                        site</a></h1>
            </div>
            <div id="tema_05_info_p">
                <p>In addition to theme 05, fundamental content, we also got introduced to basic video-production &
                    Adobe Premiere Pro. The
                    idea was for us to learn simple video-production tools and usage of these. We got introduced to the
                    basics of editing,
                    grading and shooting. More specifically to interview-guides, storyboarding, Adobe PP color-grading,
                    the 5-shots-rule,
                    rule-of-thirds, overlays etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I especially used tools like; Film-dissolve, adjustment-layers, Exponential audio gain, Constant
                    Gain, Dip to Black, Dip
                    to White, clip-speed, color-enhancer, Crossfade, lumetri color presets, cold-color-correction &
                    -grade in my productions
                    and postproductions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to use the film-dissolve and dip-to´s to create smoother transitions in my interview, the
                    reason especially
                    being that the clips were very stationary and boring, hence it being an interview on a couch.
                </p>
                <p>I used
                    the audio
                    techniques of exponential gain, constant gain and crossfade to unite and align the sound to one
                    single level, as the mic
                    picked up various different levels depending on how the interview-person sat and spoke. I tried to
                    grade as best as I
                    could with some cold and minor warm color-grading & correction, as the room was quite dark and
                    monochrome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will get
                    back to the errors of this in my reflections below. Clip speed and rule-of-thirds + b-roll were used
                    to create
                    transitioning shots as the interviewed changed form and/or subject. Also, having a b-roll can help
                    the viewer stay
                    longer / become more interested in the film, as it changes up the setting & scene, while still
                    having the same sound of
                    the a-roll.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking back, I had quite an obstacle with the first video in its post-production.
                    I write, shoot and direct short-films in my free-time, and hence this, I was very angry at the
                    overexposure of the video
                    (Retfærdighedens rytter, theme 05.1).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The overexposure happened because we shot it with HDR on an
                    iPhone, which is
                    incompatible with the H.264 file format & settings of Adobe PP - and therefore will make the video
                    turn
                    yellowish/incredibly overexposed once portrayed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tried to export in Apple formats (QuickTime in Apple ProRes HQ HLG) back to the Adobe PP standard
                    format of (H. 264) -
                    which is 4K. Hence this, I have exported the video in a monochrome to show how this also will stain
                    the project with an
                    overexposure of light, even in a monochrome version. I truly regret using an iPhone to shoot a video
                    with, as Adobe &
                    Mac rarely work well together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am used to work with .raw-files from BlackMagics in my freetime.
                    The smart thing about
                    raw-files is that they’re easily compatible with most programs and primarily used to re-export into
                    other formats of
                    choice.
