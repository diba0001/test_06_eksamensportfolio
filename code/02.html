                <p>
                    In our first theme, 02 Web (Basic Web), we were tasked with creating a website about our own
                    computer
                    and
                    the general
                    history of computers. In this theme, we primarily learned about design principles such as Gestalt
                    laws,
                    color
                    combinations, font/typography, visual hierarchies, contrasts, and compositions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I chose to base my site on earthy colors, such as green, khaki, beige, and light brown. In
                    retrospect,
                    it
                    might not have
                    been the wisest or most suitable color combination for a website about the history of computers. It
                    probably
                    would have
                    been more fitting for a healthy food store website or a tourist information site for a green area in
                    Europe.
                    Today, I
                    would probably work more with monochromatic colors for a task like 02 Web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used my knowledge of Gestalt laws to separate and unite local and global elements such as content,
                    navigation, text,
                    and images. The laws of proximity and closure were used to connect body text, headers, and images.
                    It's
                    important that
                    related elements are placed in correct proximity to each other; otherwise, the layout can be
                    perceived
                    as
                    overwhelming,
                    or that the placed elements may not actually be related. To achieve this, you can use grids,
                    display,
                    margin, padding,
                    gap, etc., especially in CSS, to ensure the respective placements and layouts of the elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, it's essential to consider how crucial it is to use elements, images, text, and
                    content
                    that
                    resemble each
                    other if they are to be perceived as similarities and part of something bigger than itself, such as
                    the
                    overall design
                    and structural layout of the page. This brings us to another Gestalt law, the law of similarity. I
                    used
                    this
                    law
                    particularly in my header and navigation, as it's important for the eye and the user to understand
                    that,
                    for
                    example,
                    the menu is composed of the same font, size, and layout to clarify and establish its purpose. It
                    creates
                    a
                    common thread
                    and an understanding that this global element has a consistent and continuous design to avoid
                    confusing
                    the
                    user. By
                    global elements, I mean content that is displayed in multiple places on the website, such as menus,
                    footers,
                    navigation
                    etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to design principles, theme 02 was, as mentioned, the first task in using basic HTML and
                    CSS. We
                    received an
                    introduction to HTML (overall structuring) and CSS (design and layout definition), and I used these
                    to
                    design and code
                    my website. Using content hierarchy, I defined local elements such as headers (HTML headings) - h1,
                    h2,
                    h3,
                    etc. - and
                    with the help of grid systems I structured horizontal and vertical boxes, setting up the visual
                    layout
                    of
                    the .html
                    pages and the placements of local elements on these very pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I chose to use grids rather than flex setups so that specific headers, texts, and images were
                    positioned
                    and
                    composed in
                    boxes. By putting things in boxes, Gestalt laws of closure and proximity are used again, visually
                    clarifying
                    that the
                    respective elements have meaning to each other but are sufficiently away from other potential
                    elements
                    with
                    which they
                    have no direct connection. This is seen, for example, in the screenshot from the site below, showing
                    how
                    the
                    gallery is
                    set up in a grid system to clarify the respective meanings of local elements. The H1 title stands
                    alone,
                    whereas the H3
                    heading and the text are close to the image series (proximity). The body has its own color, in
                    contrast
                    to
                    the header
                    and footer, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With my current knowledge, I would, however, not have as much margin between H3 and P-text, change
                    the
                    color
                    combination, and modify the size and even the font of the headers, but these are things I have
                    learned
                    since
                    then :)
